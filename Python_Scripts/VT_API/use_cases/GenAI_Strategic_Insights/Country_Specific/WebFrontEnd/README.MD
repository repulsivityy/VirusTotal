# GTI Country & Topic Specific Threat Intelligence Frontend
>readme.md generated by Gemini 3.0

This directory contains a Streamlit web application that generates threat intelligence summaries based on Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) reports. It uses Google's Gemini AI models to analyze and summarize reports relevant to a specific country and optional topic.

## Features

- **Country Filtering**: Focus on threats relevant to a specific country.
- **Topic Filtering**: Optional filtering by specific keywords or topics (e.g., "Ransomware", "Phishing").
- **Multi-Source Support**: Fetch reports from GTI, crowdsourced collections, or both.
- **AI Summarization**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash/Pro or 3 Flash Preview to generate concise executive summaries.
- **CVE Enrichment**: Automatically extracts CVEs from the summary and fetches detailed vulnerability data from GTI.
- **Cloud Run Ready**: Includes Docker configuration and deployment scripts for Google Cloud Run.

## Local Usage

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **Access**: Open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Deployment to Cloud Run (Asia-Southeast1)

A deployment script is provided to simplify deploying to Google Cloud Run in the Singapore region (`asia-southeast1`).

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    - Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) installed and authenticated.
    - A Google Cloud Project with Cloud Run and Container Registry/Artifact Registry APIs enabled.

2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    chmod +x deploy.sh
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
    Follow the prompts. The script will build the container image and deploy it to Cloud Run.

## Security & API Keys

- **No Stored Keys**: This application **DOES NOT** store API keys on the server disk or in the container image.
- **User Provided**: Users must provide their own `GTI_APIKEY` and `GEMINI_APIKEY` via the application sidebar for each session.
- **Memory Only**: Keys are held in memory during the session execution and passed directly to the API clients. They are not logged to persistent storage by the application logic.
- **Transport Security**: Ensure you access the deployed application via HTTPS (Cloud Run provides this by default) to encrypt the keys in transit.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application entry point. Handles UI and user inputs.
- `report_generator.py`: Core logic for fetching reports from GTI, generating prompts, and calling Gemini API.
- `start.sh` / `deploy.sh`: Deployment helpers.
- `Dockerfile`: Container definition for Cloud Run.
